You will be prompted to buy goods essential for your lemonade stand like cups, lemons, cups of sugar, etc FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND PURCHASE MORE ITEMS ONCE YOU HAVE CONTINUED ON INTO THE WEEK! Your beginning budget to buy goods is $200.00. There is a twist to this Lemonade Stand game. You as owner of Lemonade Stand have to take into account how weather will play a role in how customers buy lemonade BUT YOU WILL NOT KNOW THE WEATHER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SELL FOR EACH DAY. Also you have to take into account the price of your lemonade will also determine the demand for your lemonade with your customers. After each day you can see how well your lemonade stand did for the day. Remember, you only have 7 days to make as much profit as you can. Make wise decisions before hand, make your money, and last but not least, HAVE FUN! ENJOY!");
